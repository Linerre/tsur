** Reference
A reference in Rust is usually called "borrow".

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
*In most cases, references can be used much like the original value*. Field access, method calling, and indexing work the same (save for mutability rules, of course). In addition, the *comparison operators transparently defer* to the referent’s implementation, allowing references to be compared the same as owned values.
#+END_QUOTE
from:[[https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.reference.html][Primitive Type reference]] and see code [file:snippets/src/reference.rs::12]

But sometimes, passing a reference would cause compile error! In such cases, consider
~Copy~ or ~move~ the value behind the reference.

* Standard macros
* The Rust Prelude
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The /prelude/ is the list of things that Rust automatically imports into every Rust program.

The difference between ‘the prelude’ and these other preludes is that they are not automatically use’d, and *must be imported manually*.
